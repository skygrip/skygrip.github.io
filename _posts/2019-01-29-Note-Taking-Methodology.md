Note taking is critical during Incident Response and Forensics.

Having good notes can help you:
 * Save time from avoiding doing the same thing twice. When you record your findings and how you got there, you don't need to backtrack your findings to find them again
 * Develop Hypotheses. By having all your evidence in one place you can take a step back from the details and start looking at the big picture.
 * Rapidly provide status updates and reports. Writing Reports can be very time consuming, but having the key information at hand can help avoid having to start up your forensic tools again.
 * Navigate cases of Anti-Forensics or competing evidence. Uncertain data is common, and how it is handled can be key to making the right decisions. Documenting from where and how evidence was collected makes it easier to reconsider evidence and hypothesises.

My process is based upon a slightly modified version of, The major changes are modifications to make it more suitable for the digital world, and better handle Uncertain Data.
