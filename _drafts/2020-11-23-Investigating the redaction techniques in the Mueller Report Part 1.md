The Mueller Report was released a few years ago now to great controversy about the large amounts of redaction used within the report. Im using this as an excuse to explore PDF file formats to see how effective the redaction's are, and the kind of techniques your redaction system needs to address if you wish to keep your secrets hidden.

Ultimately the redaction methods used in this report were thankfully robust. Were they not robust i would not be writing about them at all!

There are two versions of the Mueller Report released at different times. The first version was released as a scanned version of the printed report, and the second was a much smaller size digital version.

If you are new to PDF documents, have a read of my introduction to PDF files [here](/2020/05/01/Understanding-PDF-Files.html)

The First version of the report
-------------------------------

The first place to look is File Metadata. This information is often forgotten and is especially relevant as it often contains the creation date and the program that created it. Then we will look at some basic information about file structure, mainly the number of images.

Let's start with looking at the first version of the report with the command pdfinfo, then listing the number of embedded image files with pdfimages, and finally the types of objects in the PDF file with pdfid.

The report was scanned by a RICOH MP C6502 multifunction printer, and every page is single image. There is no JavaScript objects (The 2 JS objects are false positives). From a view of the image quality of the scan, its clear the redaction was done digitally and then printed.

Printing out a digitally redacted version and then scanning it back in is a pretty robust way to avoid any metadata being disclosed. While it does break a lot of features such as keyword search or copy paste, and results in a horridly large PDF file, if you don't have the time or resources to validate your redaction process works, this will always be a good option.

The Second version of the Report
--------------

The second report however is a fraction of the size and appears to be a fully digital version, with searchable text. This copy does provide some potential artifacts, but it will require digging around in the depths of the PDF format.

First lets look at the files metadata.

Now lets use pdfid to have a look at the kinds of PDF objects in this document.

     ~/Downloads % ~/Build/pdf-tools/pdfid.py MuellerReport2.pdf
     PDFiD 0.2.7 MuellerReport2.pdf
      PDF Header: %PDF-1.7
      obj                 4038
      endobj              4038
      stream              3509
      endstream           3509
      xref                   0
      trailer                0
      startxref              2
      /Page                  0
      /Encrypt               0
      /ObjStm              910
      /JS                    1
      /JavaScript            0
      /AA                    0
      /OpenAction            0
      /AcroForm              1
      /JBIG2Decode           0
      /RichMedia             0
      /Launch                0
      /EmbeddedFile          0
      /XFA                   0
      /URI                   0
      /Colors > 2^24         0

This time we have a much more complex PDF file that has embedded text, however again no JavaScript.

Another trick some PDF files use are incremental updates. These are updates added to the end of a PDF file that overwrite parts of the document without needing to re-render the whole document. We can check for incremental updates by checking for multiple end of file strings.

    grep --byte-offset --text %%EOF MuellerReport2.pdf
    11435195:%%EOF
    11446220:%%EOF


We have found a incremental update, lets pull out the content of the incremental update and have a look at what it contains.

    dd if=MuellerReport2.pdf of=MuellerReport_IU2.pdf bs=1 skip=11435202

Incremental updates are not fully valid PDF files so reviewing their content must be done manually with a text editor. Opening this incremental update file in a text editor reveals that the Incremental update only updates two objects, object 2651 and 3937. Review of the new content shows that the major task the update.
